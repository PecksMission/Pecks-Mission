                <h3>📍 A Note to Those Experiencing These Symptoms</h3>
                <p>
                    Neurological issues are incredibly difficult to explain to people who haven't experienced them. 
                    The floating sensation, the inability to balance, the cognitive fog—these aren't things you're 
                    making up. They're real, they're valid, and they're incredibly challenging to live with.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>What is Chiari Malformation?</h2>
            <p>
                I was born with part of my brain (the cerebellar tonsils) sitting 1.5 cm lower than it should, pushed down into the space where my spinal cord is. My brain is blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)—think of it like a kink in a garden hose. The fluid can't flow properly, which causes pressure to build up and creates all kinds of neurological symptoms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Out of 1,000 people, only 1 has Chiari. Most are asymptomatic. Of those with symptoms, most just have headaches. Surgery becomes necessary when you have ataxia (severe balance problems preventing walking) or dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).
            </p>

            <h2>Early Warning Signs I Missed</h2>
            <p>
                Looking back, the signs were there: childhood difficulty with fine motor skills, trouble picking up small objects, speech difficulties, and an ADHD diagnosis. During my military entrance physical, I had balance problems during the examination. One time I got pulled over for speeding and failed a field sobriety test despite blowing zeros—I now understand it was the Chiari affecting my balance all along.
            </p>

            <h2>April 2025: When Everything Started</h2>
            <p>
                After a Monday morning hike with friends, Jesse and I went to the swings. While swinging, I started feeling dizzy and nauseous. That night at work in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit at Cox South Hospital, I still felt terrible—like motion sickness that wouldn't go away. Around midnight, I walked over to the hospital's urgent care. They diagnosed me with BPPV (an inner ear disorder), but I told them, "This is not vertigo; this is something else."
            </p>

            <h2>May-June 2025: Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>
                The dizziness didn't go away. By late May, I had constant tinnitus, altered hearing, and vertigo episodes lasting anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. I'd called out of work several times—I didn't feel comfortable walking with patients who'd just gotten open-heart surgery. My ENT ordered an MRI to rule out a tumor. In early June, the results came back: no tumor, but something else—a Chiari malformation. That same week, I went to an IMAX movie and had to lie in my car for 20 minutes before I could safely drive home.
            </p>

            <h2>Summer 2025: The Symptoms Get Real</h2>
            <p>
                Through June and July, my symptoms escalated: a strange floating sensation, like I was disconnected from my feet, constant headaches, and frequent nausea. The best way I could describe what I was feeling was through Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb"—distant, detached, hands feeling like balloons.
            </p>

            <div class="symptoms-grid">
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>The Floating Sensation</strong>
                    <p>It's always there, subconscious, in the back of my mind. I feel detached from what's happening around me—I can see people talking but can't fully process what they're saying. Sports became impossible due to lost hand-eye coordination.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>Morning Headaches</strong>
                    <p>I wake up with headaches every morning because pressure increases overnight. Caffeine helps, but they're always there.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="symptom-card">
                    <strong>Cognitive Fog</strong>
                    <p>I forget words frequently, lose track of what I'm saying, and blank out mid-conversation. My recall memory has changed.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                A Cine MRI in July confirmed the Chiari was blocking my spinal fluid flow. Working with CVICU patients became increasingly difficult—there were several times I had to lie down in the doctor's office. I remember one instance when I looked at a pillow and it appeared stretched, distorted. I was genuinely fearful of tripping over the chest tubes draining blood from patients' hearts. My coworkers noticed something was wrong, but neurological issues are hard to understand.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box warning">
                <h3>The Invisible Illness Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    I didn't want people thinking I was making excuses. It's hard to explain that coughing triggers a headache. That sleeping causes pressure to build overnight, guaranteeing I wake with a headache. That laughing too hard brings on a headache. How do you explain feeling like you're floating, disconnected from reality? I feel like it would be easier if I had a visible injury—something people could see and understand.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>August 2025: The Altitude Test</h2>
            <p>
                A friend and I went to Colorado. I had no symptoms hiking the Manitou Incline, which made me think I was improving. But at the top of Pikes Peak, everything changed. It felt like the world was spinning and I was walking sideways. The combination of elevation and Chiari severely exacerbated my symptoms. When I got back to Springfield, the flare-up lasted for weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mid-August, I went to the ER during a work shift. They ran a stroke protocol and did an MRI but offered no answers—just "keep waiting, work it out with a neurologist." It was frustrating.
            </p>

            <h2>September-December 2025: Nashville and the Return</h2>
            <p>
                I moved to Nashville, hoping that getting off night shift would help. I started working as a low-voltage contractor installing security systems. But working overhead in ceilings made everything worse—every time I looked up, pressure increased in my head. I stumbled on stairs and coming down ladders. I had to leave the job because it wasn't physically safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, I felt better. I joined CrossFit East Nashville, maintained seven hours of sleep nightly, and improved my diet. Sleep was the biggest factor—getting off night shift made a huge impact. But even with consistent sleep, I still woke with a headache every single morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                In December, symptoms returned aggressively. Headaches intensified, the floating sensation strengthened, stumbling worsened. I'd hoped lifestyle changes would control the symptoms, but Chiari doesn't work that way.
            </p>

            <h2>January 2026: The Worst Episode</h2>
            <p>
                In early January, I stayed at my friend Kevin's house and slept in a recliner. My neck bent backward during the night. I woke up extremely nauseous and disoriented. Kevin later told me I wasn't walking normally—I was lurching forward, using the walls to steady myself as I made my way to the bathroom. I vomited several times and couldn't maintain my balance. Kevin heard the commotion and came to check on me. He offered to help me walk back, but stubborn as I am, I refused. Looking back, I should have gone to the hospital, but I didn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed difficulty swallowing in late January—a persistent sensation like having a golf ball stuck in my throat. Dry foods like crackers became particularly challenging. A swallow evaluation showed no signs of aspiration, so I was cleared for a regular diet with modifications: adding sauces to dry foods, taking small bites, and sitting upright while eating.
            </p>

            <h2>February 2026: Current Status</h2>
            <p>
                After a 60-hour ER admission (two CAT scans, two MRIs, and a swallow exam), I secured a referral through the VA to a specialist. I'm currently unemployed because my work exacerbated my symptoms. I'm someone who needs structure, and not working has been challenging. I miss patient care, being in the action, serving others. I feel like my hands are tied right now.
            </p>

            <h2>Managing Symptoms</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>What helps:</strong> Caffeine (essential for managing headaches), proper sleep position (neck straight and elevated, never flexed), specific massage techniques (moving pressure down, not up), and faith—trusting that God has me through this.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Known triggers:</strong> Sleep position, looking upward, altitude and pressure changes, weather fluctuations, mornings (when pressure peaks overnight), awkward physical positions, and IMAX theaters.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What surprisingly doesn't trigger symptoms:</strong> Running and lifting weights—both involve controlled breathing and keeping the neck neutral.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Surgery</h2>
            <p>
                As a medic, I believe the best approach is to pursue surgery now while I'm young, unattached, and without children. There's no medication that will address swallowing issues or restore hearing loss. Physical therapy maintains symptoms but doesn't resolve them. I don't want to manage pain indefinitely—I want to fix the problem. Let's address this head-on rather than pushing it down the road. Let's be aggressive about treatment.
            </p>

            <h2>For Others Going Through This</h2>
            <p>
                One of the hardest parts is appearing fine on the outside. People see a young, healthy-looking guy and assume nothing's wrong. But internally, my brain is being compressed and cerebrospinal fluid isn't flowing properly. If you're struggling with others not understanding, focus on the people who support you and believe you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding community has been essential. When I moved to Nashville and found Stonebridge Church, I knew I was in the right place. When symptoms intensified in December, I had people praying for me and offering practical help. Don't be afraid to reach out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chiari is unpredictable. I can hike a mountain and feel fine but get overwhelmed at an IMAX theater. I can lift heavy weights with no issues but struggle after bending to pick up sticks. That's the nature of this condition—it doesn't mean you're managing it poorly.
            </p>

                        "Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything." — James 1:2-4

            </div>

            <p>
                My faith has been both tested and strengthened through this journey. When I don't have control over my symptoms or what tomorrow holds, I can trust that God has me. This season is painful, but I'm learning to depend on Him in ways I never had to before.
            </p>

            <p>
                My concern isn't about life after surgery—it's about not getting surgery and living with these symptoms indefinitely. Surgery offers hope that I can return to normal life, return to serving, and be fully present again.

                <h3>How I Explain It</h3>
                <p>
                    "I have a big brain. But don't worry, it's mostly smooth."
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all seriousness, my brain is under pressure because the base of my skull is smaller than it should be. It's a congenital condition I was born with, and now it's time to fix it.
