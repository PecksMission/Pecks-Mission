            <h2>What is Chiari Malformation?</h2>
            <p>
                Chiari malformation (pronounced kee-AH-ree) is a structural defect where the lower part of the brain 
                (the cerebellum) extends into the spinal canal. This happens when the skull is too small or misshapen, 
                putting pressure on the brain and forcing brain tissue downward.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are different types of Chiari malformations, but Type I is the most common and is what I have. 
                It often goes undiagnosed until symptoms become severe enough to warrant an MRI.
            </p>

                <h3>⚠️ The Diagnosis Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Many people live with Chiari for years—sometimes decades—without knowing it. Symptoms can be vague 
                    and easily attributed to other conditions like migraines, anxiety, or stress. On average, it takes 
                    <strong>7+ years</strong> from first symptoms to proper diagnosis.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
            <p>
                Symptoms vary widely from person to person. Some people have no symptoms at all, while others 
                experience debilitating effects daily. Common symptoms include:
            </p>

            <h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
            <p>
                It took me a long time to get diagnosed. I went through countless appointments, tests, and moments 
                of wondering if what I was experiencing was "real" or just in my head. When I finally got answers, 
                it was both a relief and the beginning of a new chapter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The journey taught me the importance of advocating for yourself in the healthcare system—something 
                I now encourage everyone to do. Trust your instincts. If something doesn't feel right, keep pushing 
                for answers.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box success">
                <h3>✓ If You're Experiencing Symptoms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Document everything:</strong> Keep a symptom diary with dates and triggers</li>
                    <li><strong>Request an MRI:</strong> Chiari can only be diagnosed through imaging</li>
                    <li><strong>Find a specialist:</strong> Look for neurologists or neurosurgeons familiar with Chiari</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't give up:</strong> Keep pushing for answers if something doesn't feel right</li>
                    <li><strong>Join support groups:</strong> Connect with others who understand what you're going through</li>
                </ul>
