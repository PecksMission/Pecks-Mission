                <h2>Why I'm Starting This Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    When I first thought about creating this website, I hesitated. Who am I to share my story? 
                    What if people think I'm complaining or seeking attention? But then I remembered all the times 
                    I felt alone in doctor's offices, all the nights I spent searching for answers online, 
                    wondering if anyone else understood what I was going through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If sharing my experience with Chiari malformation helps even one person feel less alone, or 
                    helps someone recognize symptoms and get diagnosed faster, then it's worth any discomfort I 
                    might feel about putting myself out there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site isn't about me being an expert—it's about being honest. It's about raising awareness 
                    for a condition that too many people suffer with in silence. And it's about faith, hope, and 
                    finding purpose even in our struggles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As it says in Romans 8:28, "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who 
                    love him, who have been called according to his purpose." I believe this journey, difficult as 
                    it is, has purpose—and sharing it with you is part of that.
