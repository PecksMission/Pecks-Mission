                    I've spent my career caring for people in their most vulnerable moments. Now, as I prepare for brain surgery, 
                    I'm experiencing that vulnerability firsthand—and sharing what I'm learning along the way.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>My Background: A Life of Service</h2>
            <p>
                I served as a medic in the military, where I learned the profound responsibility of caring for others 
                in life-or-death situations. Those experiences shaped my understanding of resilience, teamwork, 
                and the sacred trust between caregiver and patient.
            </p>
            <p>
                After my military service, I worked in a Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU), where I witnessed 
                both the fragility and incredible resilience of the human body and spirit. Every day brought new 
                challenges—heart surgeries, critical emergencies, and families waiting for news about their loved ones. 
                I learned to read vital signs, anticipate complications, and provide comfort in the midst of fear.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I didn't fully understand then was what it felt like to be on the other side of that experience—to 
                be the one in the bed, watching the monitors, waiting for answers, depending on others for care.
            </p>

            <h2>When Everything Changed: Becoming the Patient</h2>
            <p>
                Then life changed. I was diagnosed with Chiari malformation, and suddenly I went from being the 
                caregiver to the patient. It's been a humbling journey—one that's taught me more about empathy, 
                patience, and faith than I ever learned in my training.
            </p>
            <p>
                The symptoms had been there for a while, but like many people with Chiari, I didn't know what I was 
                dealing with. Headaches, dizziness, pain—things I tried to push through because that's what I'd 
                always done. Getting the diagnosis was both a relief and the beginning of a new, uncertain chapter.
            </p>
            <p>
                But nothing prepared me for what came next: the decision to have surgery. Brain surgery. The words 
                alone carry weight that's impossible to fully describe until you're facing it yourself.
            </p>

            <h2>Right Now: Preparing for Surgery</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently preparing for decompression surgery—a procedure that will relieve the pressure on my 
                brain and spinal cord. The surgery date is approaching, and I'm documenting every step of this journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why share something so personal and vulnerable? Because I've been on both sides now. I know what 
                healthcare providers see and do. And I'm learning what patients experience but often don't communicate. 
                There's a gap—and bridging that gap can transform how we care for each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn't about being brave or inspiring. It's about being honest. It's about helping others understand 
                what this experience really looks like—the medical appointments, the insurance battles, the physical 
                preparations, the emotional processing, the fear, the faith, and everything in between.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box warning">
                <h3>What I'm Learning as Both Caregiver and Patient</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The waiting is harder than I realized:</strong> As a caregiver, I moved quickly between tasks. As a patient, every day before surgery feels heavy with anticipation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vulnerability requires courage:</strong> Asking for help doesn't come naturally when you're used to providing it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small gestures matter immensely:</strong> A kind word, a listening ear, a simple "I'm thinking of you" carries more weight than I understood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical decisions feel different from this side:</strong> When it's your own brain, your own life, every choice becomes deeply personal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Faith becomes tangible:</strong> This isn't theoretical anymore—it's the daily choice to trust God with what I cannot control.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>My Faith & Purpose Through This</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a person of faith who attends church regularly and feels called to serve others in whatever 
                capacity God opens up. Right now, that means being honest about this journey and what I'm learning 
                through it.
            </p>
            <p>
                There have been moments of fear—I won't pretend otherwise. Brain surgery is serious, and the unknown 
                is real. But I believe that God is present in all of it. He's in the diagnosis, in the decision to 
                have surgery, in the waiting, and in whatever comes after.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't know exactly where God is leading me, but I believe that everything—including this 
                condition and this surgery—can be used for good. If sharing my story helps even one person feel less 
                alone, helps a healthcare provider understand their patient better, or helps a family member know 
                how to support their loved one, then it's worth the vulnerability.
            </p>

                        "I've learned that our trials don't define us—our response to them does. And when we anchor ourselves in faith, 
                        we find strength we never knew we had. Now I'm learning that receiving care with grace is just as important 
                        as giving it with compassion."

            <h2>What's Next: Surgery, Recovery, and Beyond</h2>
            <p>
                In the coming days and weeks, I'll undergo surgery. I'll experience recovery from the patient's perspective. 
                I'll face challenges I've helped others through but never personally navigated. And I'll be sharing it all—the 
                good days, the hard days, the lessons learned, and the grace received.
            </p>
            <p>
                After recovery, I hope to continue raising awareness about Chiari malformation and to explore ways of helping 
                bridge the gap between clinical care and patient experience. I'm interested in writing, speaking, and possibly 
                even ministry work that focuses on supporting those facing medical challenges.
